# Privacy-First Content Recommendation System

## Project Goal

The **Privacy-First Content Recommendation System** aims to deliver personalized content recommendations with a focus on data privacy, user experience, and scalability. This project is designed for large-scale applications and adheres to the best practices in frontend architecture, backend infrastructure, and data privacy, with a strict commitment to compliance with European data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).

## Key Objectives

1.  **Scalable Architecture**: Create a modular, flexible system that scales seamlessly with user growth, ensuring high performance without compromising user privacy.
2.  **Data Privacy Compliance**: Architect the system to comply with European privacy laws, minimizing data exposure, and protecting user information at every level.
3.  **User-Centric Approach**: Design with the user in mind, creating an interface that enhances engagement through responsive design and intuitive interactions.
4.  **Efficiency in Frontend and Backend**: Apply best practices for component-driven frontend design and microservice-based backend architecture to optimize for both usability and system resilience.

## Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: React with Client-Side Rendering (CSR) for modular, component-driven UI.
-   **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript, employing REST API design principles.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL with field-level encryption for sensitive data.
-   **Infrastructure**: Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, and either an American cloud platform (AWS, GCP) or EU-centric options (e.g., OVHCloud).
-   **Monitoring and Logging**: Prometheus and Grafana for observability.
-   **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library for frontend tests, Mocha for backend tests.

## Features

### Core Functionalities

1.  **User-Centric Content Recommendations**: Provides users with personalized content recommendations based on anonymized and locally stored preferences.
2.  **Data Privacy-Focused Storage**: All personal data remains on the client side where possible, with only anonymized metadata sent to the backend.
3.  **Responsive Interface**: Built with accessibility-first and mobile-first principles, ensuring consistent performance across devices.

### Privacy-Specific Features

-   **Local Preference Storage**: Stores user preferences on the client side (localStorage) for reduced backend exposure.
-   **GDPR-Compliant Consent Management**: Allows users to control tracking preferences directly within the UI.
-   **Data Minimization**: Only necessary metadata is collected, reducing privacy risks and ensuring compliance with European data regulations.

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend (React with CSR)

The frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with React for an engaging user experience. It uses **Client-Side Rendering** (CSR) to handle routing and dynamic updates, minimizing reloads and enhancing performance.

#### Component Structure

-   **Atomic Design Principles**: Organize components into atoms (buttons, labels), molecules (forms, cards), and organisms (entire sections of a page) to promote reusability and consistency.
-   **State Management**: Use Redux Toolkit or Zustand for structured and optimized state handling.
-   **Theming and Accessibility**: Theme tokens (colors, typography) are set globally, and ARIA standards are applied for screen readers and keyboard navigation.

### Backend (Node.js with TypeScript)

The backend is composed of several RESTful microservices, each responsible for specific functionalities. It’s designed to handle a high volume of requests and data securely.

#### API Endpoints

-   **GET /recommendations**: Provides personalized, anonymized content recommendations based on metadata.
-   **POST /interactions**: Logs anonymized user interactions for analytics, adhering to GDPR guidelines.

### Database (PostgreSQL with Encryption)

The database stores anonymized user interaction data with **field-level encryption** for added security. This ensures that any sensitive information remains unreadable without decryption keys.

### Infrastructure and Deployment

-   **Containerization**: Docker is used to create isolated environments, ensuring consistency across development, testing, and production.
-   **Orchestration**: Kubernetes manages service deployment and scaling, enabling automatic load balancing and self-healing for high availability.
-   **Monitoring and Observability**: Prometheus collects system metrics, and Grafana visualizes them for real-time monitoring and alerts.

## Data Privacy and Compliance

In adherence to **GDPR** and other European privacy laws, this project prioritizes data privacy and user rights at every stage of data handling.

1.  **Data Minimization**: Only essential user interactions are stored, and personal identifiers are excluded.
2.  **User Consent**: Users are prompted to opt in for any form of tracking or analytics, with clear, accessible options to adjust these preferences.
3.  **Anonymization**: Where data must be stored, anonymization techniques are applied to ensure that individual users cannot be re-identified.
4.  **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive data stored on the backend is encrypted to protect it from unauthorized access.

## Design System

The project employs a design system to ensure visual and functional consistency across components:

1.  **Atomic Design Principles**: Organizes the UI into reusable components for better scalability and ease of maintenance.
2.  **Theme Tokens**: Centralized colors, typography, and spacing tokens for consistent styling and easier theming.
3.  **Accessibility Standards**: ARIA labels, high contrast, and keyboard navigability to make the application accessible for all users.

## Data Structures

1.  **Trie**: For fast search and autocomplete, used in the recommendation engine for keyword matching.
2.  **Hash Table**: Efficiently stores user preferences, providing quick access by hashed keys.
3.  **Graph**: Represents relationships between content, enabling personalized recommendation paths.
4.  **Bloom Filter**: Helps with efficient session validation, offering a lightweight, memory-efficient approach to session storage.
